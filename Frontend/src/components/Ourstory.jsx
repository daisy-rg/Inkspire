    It all began on a quiet, broken evening when the world outside my window felt like it was crashing in slow motion.
    I was just a girl, small in a life too big, surrounded by noise but feeling unbearably invisible.
    At home, words were never gentle; love came with conditions, and silence was the loudest sound.
    I started writing because I needed somewhere to go that didn’t hurt. The pages didn’t yell, they didn’t leave, and
    they didn’t ask me to be anything more than exactly who I was. Each sentence was a door — away from the fights, the
    pretending, the loneliness. I wrote until the pain had a shape, and then I wrote until that shape softened. Stories
    became my sanctuary, my rebellion, my therapy. Through characters, I spoke the truths I never could. Through poetry,
    I stitched together pieces of a heart that had cracked quietly for years. Writing wasn’t just an escape; it was a
    rescue. The ink didn't just express me — it rebuilt me. And somewhere in those midnights, I stopped writing just for
    myself and began dreaming of a place where others could write and feel safe too. That’s why <strong>Inkspire</strong> exists. Not just for stories,
    but for healing. For those who need a home inside words. For the ones who survive by writing — like I did. Like I still do.
